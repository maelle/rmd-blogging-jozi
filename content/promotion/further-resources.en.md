## Promotion

* [My blog post "Get on your soapbox! R blog content and promotion"](https://masalmon.eu/2018/07/16/soapbox/)

* [How to have (my) content shared by R Weekly?](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org#how-to-have-my-content-shared-by-r-weekly)

* Look into how to add a (category specific) RSS feed to your blog, if there's not one by default. For R Bloggers, that feed needs to feature the full content of posts.

## Comments

* [My blog post about utteranc.es](https://masalmon.eu/2019/10/02/disqus/) (which means you need to use GitHub...)

* [Schnack, a simple Disqus-like drop-in commenting system written in JavaScript.](https://github.com/schn4ck/schnack) read about [in a post of Noam Ross'](https://www.noamross.net/2019/08/09/a-new-website/)

* Not very recent but useful [ Blog comment systems: Disqus alternatives](https://fedidat.com/530-blog-comments/)

* In WordPress, built-in.


## Citations

* [Hugo template for adding citation metadata to posts by SÃ©bastien Rochette](https://github.com/statnmap/hugo-statnmap-theme/blob/3e2a54a9836fdd65779865e91058ba304b628336/layouts/partials/citation.html)

## Analytics

If you use another service than Google Analytics, I'd be glad to hear about your experience.

## Negative feedback

* The topic of negative feedback is mentioned in [The Ladybug podcast about Blogging](https://www.ladybug.dev/episodes/blogging-101?rq=blogging)

* Twitter [soft block](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Soft%20Block). You can also _mute_ accounts.

* When you are wrong, don't get defensive. Thread below.
