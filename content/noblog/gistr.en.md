You can post short snippets, images, etc. to [GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com/).

You can even use the [`gistr` package by Scott Chamberlain](https://docs.ropensci.org/gistr/).

However contrary to dev.to gists are not really, at least in my experience, a platform where people go discover content.
Therefore you might want to list gists from somewhere else. 
A portfolio (so a blog after all, ah! Hugo [lets you easily embed gists](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#gist)), a tweet (ephemerous attention).
