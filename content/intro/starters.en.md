* In this course I expect some familiarity with R Markdown. Only the basics, some of you discovered R Markdown _yesterday_!

* I use the usethis package a lot :robot: :sparkles:, and recommend doing so. Follow [usethis setup article](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html) in particular [_"Use usethis or devtools in interactive work"_](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html#use-usethis-or-devtools-in-interactive-work-1) and the Git/GitHub stuff.

* If you use GitLab, not GitHub, you can follow [Heidi Seibold's instructions _"Setup Git RStudio GitLab"_](https://gitlab.com/HeidiSeibold/setup-git-rstudio-gitlab). There is no helper similar to `usethis::use_github()` to my knowledge.

* You should be able to follow the course and manage a blog without any git knowledge. Now for later, if you feel curious about version control, I'd recommend checking out [happygitwithr.com](https://happygitwithr.com/) and [Suzan Baert's blog post about git](https://suzan.rbind.io/2018/03/reflections-4-months-of-github/).
