Some resources around web development that I found interesting.

You might need to learn more about web development to

* tweak things yourself;
* learn the language of the web developer you hire.

For fun, I recommend reading [the dev.to post "How to build a website in 2020"](https://dev.to/thegreengreek/how-to-build-a-website-in-2020-4f0m) ([more about dev.to as a blogging platform](/noblog/devto/)).
