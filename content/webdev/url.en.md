Having your own domain is in my opinion a great idea as opposed to depending on a commercial platform / your employer.

+ Search for "custom domain + tool you're using for deploying your website".

+ Follow instructions.

+ Be patient, there are things like caches etc. so it might take time until it works.

+ Read funny and useful posts like [Custom domain hosting with Github and Namecheap](https://blog.brooke.science/posts/custom-domain-hosting-with-github-and-namecheap/)
