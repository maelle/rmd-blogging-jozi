[JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) is a way to build website created & promoted by the company Netlify. 
From what I understand all three things shown in this course are more or less JAMStack (WordPress is not a part of the JAMStack but I've seen WordPress REST API [called "headless WordPress" and classified as JAMStack CMS](https://jamstack.wtf/#cms) :shrug:)

You might find [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org) and [jamstack.wtf](https://jamstack.wtf/) interesting for your own learning or for better interacting with web developers you might hire.
