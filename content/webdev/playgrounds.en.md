With web development as with many other things being able to experiment increases your chance to solve a problem, like [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) for R.

* Create a new distill/Hugo website and play in it. You might like this [Lorem Ipsum Hugo shortcode](https://www.giffgaff.io/tech/lorem-ipsum-shortcode-for-hugo/).

* Create a free wordpress.com website (with which you cannot use goodpress, though), or some other sort of throw away Wordpress instance.

* For HTML+JS+CSS independently from website generation, use a code playground such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) (or [build your own for blog posts](https://masalmon.eu/2020/04/21/css-snippet/) :smile_cat:).

* For sketching layouts apart from drawing on paper :grin: there are tools like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (that has a free version) and [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) (macOS only, no free version).
