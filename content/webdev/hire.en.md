In the intro I mentioned that your blogging framework should be either fit in your workflow or use tools that you want to invest time in. 

If you want tweaks compared to default themes, you might need to hire a web developer / designer.
There are also companies providing themes with support (so not tweaked).

I'm not advertising for anything in particular, just reminding you that time is money or at least a finite resource. :wink:

I don't have good tips for how to choose a web development company/person apart from knowing what you want and need (if you know Hugo templating, maybe you just need HTML+JS+CSS, for instance).
