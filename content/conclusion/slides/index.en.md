Scientific blogging with R Markdown
===================================

:sob: Nearly time to say goodbye!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   distill: perfect, not flexible

-   Hugo&hugodown: very flexible (too flexible?), changes fast, experimental R package

-   WordPress&goodpress: also flexible, even more experimental R package

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What to choose
==============

-   distill

-   Hugo Academic with [`hugodown::create_site_academic()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/hugodown/man/create_site_academic.html)

-   WordPress if you already use WordPress?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What to choose
==============

Start by playing! Don't commit right away.

Does any of you want to say what they'd choose and why?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

True for all
============

-   Read the docs and follow development! :eyes:

-   Backup! :warning:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change your mind?
=================

-   Migration tools

-   `yaml`, `commonmark` packages, etc.

-   Redirects! URLs are important. 404 page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have fun!
=========

If you're worried about blogging, find a blogging buddy to read your drafts?

Make efforts but don't be perfectionist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup is not fun
================

-   With R helper packages, setup is smoother

-   But in general setup = learning a new thing, hard but then you get used to it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regular blogging?
=================

No you don't have to unless you call your blog "the daily blog" or so. :wink:

Only write if you enjoy it! Your blog can be a portfolio/news board only.
