## Read the manual :wink:

There aren't many pages in [distill docs website](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) so I'd recommend reading all of them if you commit to this website builder.

## Follow developments? :eyes:

If you start using distill for your website...

* Read the changelog when updating the package?

* [Watch development on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository)?

* Subscribe to the [issues](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues) that are interesting to you: [search](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues/9), [ORCID](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues/21), etc.?

## A warning about customization :warning:

> A word of warning though: Distill (the original library upon which the R package is based) is strongly opinionated about CSS and sometimes it's tricky or impossible to change things. Just to say your mileage may vary and if there is something you can't quite get right there is not likely much we can do about it -- *JJ Allaire [in a GitHub issue](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues/100#issuecomment-508075573)*.

{{% notice tip %}}
If you liked distill's looks but would like further customization, and if you like Hugo that we'll present in the next section, check out [this Distill theme for Hugo](https://github.com/activatedgeek/distillpub).
