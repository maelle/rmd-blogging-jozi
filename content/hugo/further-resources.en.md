## Read the manual :wink:

You can read the [whole hugodown docs](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/) and probably should especially as hugodown evolves.

Also read the docs of the theme you choose.

You might not need to read [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/), that are much longer, much more overwhelming: you mostly only need to read Hugo docs when you need to tweak or customize a theme.

## Follow developments? :eyes:

If you start using Hugo & hugodown for your website...

* [Watch development on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) of hugodown, of the theme?

* Subscribe to the [hugodown issues](https://github.com/r-lib/hugodown/issues) that are interesting to you?

* Also keep an eye on what's happening for [blogdown](#another-r-package-blogdown-)!

## Contributing guide for your website :pencil:

Personal website: take notes to not forget what you tweaked, etc.

Collaborative website: even Hugo users might not know your website structure!

* [rOpenSci blog guide](https://blogguide.ropensci.org/)

* [golemverse website contributing guide](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golemverse.org/blob/master/how-to.Rmd)

## Where to get help? :wave:

* [RStudio community forum](https://community.rstudio.com/c/R-Markdown/10) (RMarkdown category)

* [hugodown issue tracker](https://github.com/r-lib/hugodown/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

* If you start tweaking Hugo templates, [Hugo forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/)

## Other Hugo themes :school_satchel:

{{< tweet 1329502762376306692 >}}

* Browse the [gallery](https://themes.gohugo.io/). [Choose your theme wisely](https://masalmon.eu/2020/02/29/hugo-maintenance/#choose-your-theme-wisely-and-keep-in-touch). Use Hugo docs to create new site. Follow [hugodown configuration docs](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/articles/config.html).

* [Hire someone](/webdev/hire/)?

## Another R package: blogdown :package:

[blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) is an alternative to hugodown. 
It might be better for your needs if you need something more complex than what hugodown provides: e.g. there are two special scripts build.R and build2.R for running arbitrary code before and after building your website.

The comparison [hugodown vs blogdown](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/#compared-to-blogdown) is **outdated** as of blogdown new version.

The [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) will soon be updated. In the meantime read the package docs + its source code including its [changelog](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/blob/master/NEWS.md).

Follow [RStudio blog](https://blog.rstudio.com/categories/r-markdown/).

## Hugo and CMS  :computer:

To give a less technical interface to a Hugo website, you could use a CMS, see for instance [what Steph Locke set up in this website with Netlify CMS](https://github.com/hzi-braunschweig/serohub).

## Hugo template development/tweaking :nut_and_bolt:

* How _I_ started: I needed to tweak one thing in an existing theme and I googled that thing; then I had to tweak one more thing; etc. Others might have built a theme from scratch.

* [Mike Dane's tutorials](https://www.mikedane.com/static-site-generators/hugo/)

* Threads indicating resources for beginners and the lack thereof: [2018](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/comprehensive-hugo-tutorial-for-beginners/12586), [2019](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/list-of-comprehensive-tutorials-for-beginners-2019/19654)

* What you must know according to Steph Locke
